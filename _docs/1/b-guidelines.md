Guidelines give the community a direct and consistent set of rules.
We have these rules for both our server and forum.
Keep in mind that obvious laws may not be mentioned here so common sense at all times is vital.
If you are caught violating the guidelines, an administrator can take the action they deem necessary.

## Server guidelines
Our server tries to maintain freedom and equality for all members.
To keep that freedom, we must create rules that seperate right and wrong on our server.

### Bannable offenses
These offenses can result in a twenty-four-hour ban or greater.
They may also result in a suspension if repeated noticeably by the same member.

 - Purposely crashing or corrupting any world on the server in any way.
 - Mass griefing or "unrecoverable actions", mostly occurring in WorldEdit.
 - Flooding the server with chat messages, accounts, or using DDOS/DOS methods against the server.
 - Using harmful hack client methods (crash books, forceop signs, etc.) against a member or the server.
 - Using harmful items (crash potions, crash chests, etc.) against a member or the server.
 - Posing or attempting to log in as admins or known members.
 - Using collected or "spambot" accounts (this includes accounts received from alt dispensers) to log in.
 - Bypassing a ban with an alternate account, and/or bypassing an IP ban with a proxy/VPS.
 - Referring or linking to malicious, pornographic, or hate content in chat (you can PM someone with their consent).
 - Committing rogue activity as a higher rank or administrator (this includes abuse, or breaking rules with knowledge).
 - Threatening real-life harm to yourself or another member (including suicidal threats and suicide notes).

### Temporarily bannable offenses
These offenses can result in a smite, verbal warning, or short-time ban if done lightly (ex. breaking only six
blocks in someone's build).
They may also result in a twenty-four-hour ban or greater (ex. griefing someone's build massively on purpose, or WorldEdit grief).

 - Griefing, damaging, or building on other's property (regardless if you repaired it or not).
 - Plagiarism of content and copying member's builds without their consent.
 - Advertising your server IP or a website in public chat.
 - Using "trolling" techniques on admins or other members.
 - Using a nickname that could offend someone else.
 - Any act of racism, sexism, or hate crimes (offending a lot of people could result in suspension).
 - Falsely reporting other members or attempting to frame a member (including admins).
 - Comments that are potentially sexist, racist, homophobic, or directed to offend a known member on the server (denouncing someone's religious views also counts).
 - Violating the privacy of others by teleporting to them or their builds (unless you have their permission).
 - Teleporting members without their permission. This also includes modifying another member's `tptoggle`.
 - Announcing the IP (Internet Provider) address of any admin or member in public chat, or in message without the owner of that IP's consent.
 - Using offensive tags or nicknames designed to anger or offend (a good example would be using "FuckAllAdmins"), or nicking others without their permission.
 - Tampering with the inventories of other members without their permission, or spamming inventories with items.
 - Changing the WorldEdit limit without permission from an admin.
 - Begging for an administrative rank.

### Allowed
These actions are allowed unless told otherwise by an administrator.

 - Curse and/or swear, this server is welcome to all ages therefore we do not censor worded profanity.
 - Build artistic nudity and demonstrations of intercourse if it's mentioned as NSFW (not safe for work).
 - Publicly role-playing on the server (only if you're not spamming).
 - Using hacked mods and clients that aren't harmful to other members or the server.
 - Using a proxy or VPN to cloak your IP (only if you're not bypassing IP ban).
 
## Forum guidelines
As with our server, we prefer to maintain freedom of speech on our forum.
That being said, regulations are necessary to keep discussions in order.
Our forum guidelines also apply to the general website and Discord server.

- **Don't spam or power-post.** Power-posting is usually defined as posting nonsensical messages or over-posting the same thing for no reason. Try not to make whole new posts simply for the sake of adding on to something you posted earlier. Instead, use the edit feature to make corrections when you can and don't make posts for short responses (people usually make a post to say 'yeah' or agree with somebody). If you are going to make a post, compliment it with a good, meaningful sentence that is easy to understand and worth somebody's time reading.

- **Don't make discussions with the wrong tag.** Flarum uses a tag system so members know which posts are about what. This allows somebody with specific knowledge to answer posts quickly and filter out what they don't want to read. Always make sure the tags you add to your discussion are relevant. Don't add irrelevant tags to attract people's attention, your post may end up getting deleted.

- **Don't start spam discussions.** This would be a discussion simply made for the sake of spamming, also known as 'shit-posting'. Only create discussions with a unique topic and always make sure somebody hasn't already discussed what you are posting. Threads like these will be removed.

- **Don't hijack threads.** Thread hijacking is replying to an existing discussion with a different topic. Only make posts that are relevant to the discussion you're posting them on.

- **Don't evade server perm-ban.** If you were subject to a server perm-ban then you may not create an account. Remember, anyone (an account or not) can read documentation. Don't make an account just to plead with admins in hope that they'll unban you. That won't happen.

- **Don't evade a forum ban.** Making a new account when you have already been banned from the forum is not allowed. We will delete your account anyway.

- **Don't plagiarise.** If you don't already know the definition, plagiarism is copying someone else's work and calling it your own. Posts can be deleted for plagiarism.

- **Adhere to copyright.** Don't post anything against copyright law on the forum. We are based in the United States, so we follow U.S. law. Your post will be removed if it violates copyright and (if needed) you will be reported to the proper authorities.

- **Keep control of your account.** The account you create and keep secure is your responsibility. If your account is hijacked, it is your responsibility to notify the Shadow.GA administration and have it removed. You can suffer penalties for keeping your account insecure. Always make sure to use a secure password that you won't forget. This includes getting hacked.

- **Keep control of your IP.** The Internet Provider address you create an account and post with is your responsibility. If another account on the forum acts up, both accounts will receive penalties which may result in a ban. Possible siblings or users of the same Internet connection that use your account or create an account after you will also be your responsibility. This includes getting hacked.
