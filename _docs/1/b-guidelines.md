Guidelines give the community a direct and consistent set of rules.
We have these rules for both our server and forum.
If you are caught violating the guidelines, an administrator can take the action they deem necessary.

### Server guidelines
Our server tries to maintain freedom and equality for all members.
To keep that freedom, we must create rules that seperate right and wrong on our server.

- **Don't harm the server.** Don't deliberately lag, crash, or corrupt the world in any way. We have plugins to prevent lag, but only perform massive edits with the permission of an administrator. Deliberately lagging, crashing, or corrupting the world in any way is forbidden. Don't attempt to weaken the server's response time with lag machines; and don't corrupt the game by using exploits such as chests and other various blocks. Flooding any chat with messages using plain text, commands, or hacks isn't allowed. The same goes for bot accounts, fake members that join the server to spam or lag us. Advertising isn't allowed in the main chat.

- **Don't harm others.** Respect the wishes of other people by giving them privacy. If you think you're annoying someone, it's best to simply stay away from them so you don't anger them further. Destroying the builds of others, called griefing, isn't allowed. Administrators are capable of rolling back any grief using a block logging tool. Don't 'troll' others or use derogatory remarks; such as comments that are potentially sexist, racist, homophobic, or directed to offend someone. Don't use hacks or exploits that can annoy others, such as potions or mobs.

- **Don't be malicious.** Hacked clients are allowed, but only if they don't harm the server or other players. Using hacks to unfairly fight, compete, or break other rules isn't allowed. Don't refer to malicious, pornographic, or hateful content in chat. Committing rogue activity as an administrator (such as abuse or intently violating the guidelines) will result in a suspension. Don't modify the inventory of others or their `tptoggle` without consent from that member. Attempting to frame people with false reports (including administrators) is forbidden and administrator reports should be made through the website.

- **Don't plagiarise.** The act of invading other's builds or using someone else's schematics without permission from the original creator is forbidden. Taking credit for the builds of others isn't allowed unless the responsible architect allows you to do so. Although you can download any schematic from the server, respect the wishes of others by not uploading their content to sites.

- **Adhere to staff.** You shouldn't try logging in with an alternate account when banned. Evading your ban by using a proxy or virtual private network isn't allowed and can result in a suspension. Don't attempt to undermine administrators by ignoring or blocking them. Don't use other services such as Dynmap to appeal your ban. Instead, you can appeal through the website.

- **Use common sense.** Don't use offensive tags or nicknames designed to offend. Threatening harm to yourself or other members, including suicide-related threads, will result in an immediate suspension. If an administrator doesn't like what they see, they're entitled to punish for something that isn't directly mentioned in our guidelines. Always use common sense.
 
### Forum guidelines
As with our server, we prefer to maintain freedom of speech on our forum.
That being said, regulations are necessary to keep discussions in order.
These guidelines also apply to the guild and other resources.

- **Be respectful.** If another member seems to be irritated by your actions, leave them alone. Don't post inappropriate or potentially offensive content on the forum. Any discussion made for the purpose of ranting on others will be deleted. Members should only argue or debate in discussions made for that purpose. Like our server guidelines, trolling is frowned upon and shouldn't take place here.

- **Don't spam or power-post.** Power-posting is usually defined as posting nonsensical messages or over-posting the same thing for no reason. Try not to make whole new posts simply for the sake of adding on to something you posted earlier. Instead, use the edit feature to make corrections when you can and don't make posts for short responses (people usually make a post to say 'yeah' or agree with somebody). If you are going to make a post, compliment it with a good, meaningful sentence that is easy to understand and worth somebody's time reading.

- **Don't make discussions with the wrong tag.** Flarum uses a tag system so members know which posts are about what. This allows somebody with specific knowledge to answer posts quickly and filter out what they don't want to read. Always make sure the tags you add to your discussion are relevant. Don't add irrelevant tags to attract people's attention or your post may be removed.

- **Don't hijack threads.** Thread hijacking is replying to an existing discussion with a different topic. Only make posts that are relevant to the discussion you're posting them on. Don't start spam discussions or posts, content simply made for the sake of spamming, also known as 'shit-posting'. Only create discussions with a unique topic and always make sure somebody hasn't already discussed what you are posting. Posts like these will be deleted.

- **Adhere to the law.** Don't post anything against copyright law on the forum. We are based in the United States, so we follow U.S. law. Your post will be removed if it violates copyright and (if needed) you will be reported to the proper authorities. Plagiarism isn't tolerated here; don't copy posts or work from somewhere else without the original author's permission.

- **Keep control of your account.** The account you create and keep secure is your responsibility. Don't let others have access to your account information, and if that happens you should have your password changed immediately. If an alternate account acts up, your main account will also be sanctioned. Members should notify an Executive or higher before making another account if they intend to do so. It's your responsibility to take care of your account; that means having a secure username, password, and e-mail address. Check out the security page for more info.
