When members aren’t doing the right thing, admins are capable of punishing them.
It's important for everyone to know our administration's guidelines for proper gameplay and activity.
You can appeal a ban depending on the offense’s severity. If others are breaking our rules, you can take action.

## Guidelines
Guidelines give the community a direct and consistent set of rules.
We have these rules for both our server and forum.
If you are caught violating the guidelines, an administrator can take the action they deem necessary—such as banning your account.

### Server guidelines
Our server tries to maintain freedom and equality for all members.
To keep that freedom, we must create rules that seperate right and wrong on our server.

- **Don't harm the server.** Don't deliberately lag, crash, or corrupt the world in any way. We have plugins to prevent lag, but only perform massive edits with the permission of an administrator. Don't attempt to weaken the server's response time with lag machines; and don't corrupt the game by using exploits such as chests and other various blocks. Flooding any chat with messages using plain text, commands, or hacks isn't allowed. The same goes for bot accounts, fake members that join the server to spam or lag us. Advertising isn't allowed in the main chat.

- **Don't harm others.** Respect the wishes of other people by giving them privacy. If you think you're annoying someone, it's best to simply stay away from them so you don't anger them further. Destroying the builds of others, called griefing, isn't allowed. Administrators are capable of rolling back any grief using a block logging tool. Don't 'troll' others or use derogatory remarks; such as comments that are potentially sexist, racist, homophobic, or directed to offend someone. Don't use hacks or exploits that can annoy others, such as potions or mobs.

- **Don't be malicious.** Hacked clients are allowed, but only if they don't harm the server or other players. Using hacks to unfairly fight, compete, or break other rules isn't allowed. Don't refer to malicious, pornographic, or hateful content in chat. Committing rogue activity as an administrator (such as abuse or intently violating the guidelines) will result in a suspension. Don't modify the inventory of others or their `tptoggle` without consent from that member. Attempting to frame people with false reports (including administrators) is forbidden and administrator reports should be made through the website.

- **Don't plagiarise.** The act of invading other's builds or using someone else's schematics without permission from the original creator is forbidden. Taking credit for the builds of others isn't allowed unless the responsible architect gives you credit. Although you can download any schematic from the server, respect the wishes of others by not uploading their content to other sites.

- **Comply with staff.** You shouldn't try logging in with an alternate account when banned. Evading your ban by using a proxy or virtual private network isn't allowed and can result in a suspension. Don't attempt to undermine administrators by ignoring or blocking them. Don't use other services such as Dynmap to appeal your ban. Instead, you can appeal through the website.

- **Use common sense.** Don't use offensive tags or nicknames designed to offend. Threatening harm to yourself or other members, including suicide-related threads, will result in an immediate suspension. If an administrator doesn't like what they see, they're entitled to punish for something that isn't directly mentioned in our guidelines. Always use common sense.
 
### Forum guidelines
We also prefer to maintain the freedom of speech on our forum.
That being said, regulations are necessary to keep discussions in order.
These guidelines also apply to the guild and other resources.

- **Be respectful.** If another member seems to be irritated by your actions, leave them alone. Don't post inappropriate or potentially offensive content on the forum. Any discussion made for the purpose of ranting on others will be deleted. Members should only argue or debate in discussions made for that purpose. Like our server guidelines, trolling is frowned upon and shouldn't take place here.

- **Don't spam or power-post.** Power-posting is usually defined as posting nonsensical messages or over-posting the same thing for no reason. Try not to make whole new posts simply for the sake of adding on to something you posted earlier. Instead, use the edit feature to make corrections when you can and don't make posts for short responses (people usually make a post to say 'yeah' or agree with somebody). If you are going to make a post, compliment it with a good, meaningful sentence that is easy to understand and worth somebody's time reading.

- **Don't make discussions with the wrong tag.** Flarum uses a tag system so members know which posts are about what. This allows somebody with specific knowledge to answer posts quickly and filter out what they don't want to read. Always make sure the tags you add to your discussion are relevant. Don't add irrelevant tags to attract people's attention or your post may be removed.

- **Don't hijack threads.** Thread hijacking is replying to an existing discussion with a different topic. Only make posts that are relevant to the discussion you're posting them on. Don't start spam discussions or posts, content simply made for the sake of spamming, also known as 'shit-posting'. Only create discussions with a unique topic and always make sure somebody hasn't already discussed what you are posting. Posts like these will be deleted.

- **Adhere to the law.** Don't post anything against copyright law on the forum. We are based in the United States, so we follow U.S. law. Your post will be removed if it violates copyright and (if needed) you will be reported to the proper authorities. Plagiarism isn't tolerated here; don't copy posts or work from somewhere else without the original author's permission.

- **Control your account.** The account you create and keep secure is your responsibility. Don't let others have access to your account information, and if that happens you should have your password changed immediately. If an alternate account acts up, your main account will also be sanctioned. Members should notify an Executive or higher before making another account if they intend to do so. It's your responsibility to take care of your account; that means having a secure username, password, and e-mail address. Check out the security page for more info.

## Suspension
The status of being suspended can be given to any member that breaks the rules to a point where banning them is ineffective.
Members can be suspended by Executives or the Server Owner if they are petitioned to do so by another administrator.
Here are the penalties of suspension:

* You are banned from the server, meaning you can never join again. If you bypass this, you will remain under suspension.
* Your forum account is disabled, stripping you of all forum permissions.
* We'll ban your Discord account from the guild if you have one.
* Depending on how severe the crime is, you may be banned from visiting the website.
* If the crime is unlawful, such as threatening harm to yourself or others, your location and known alias will be forwarded to local authorities.

Depending on how severe the reason is, a member can be suspended indefinitely or for a fixed time.
Indefinite suspensions cannot be appealed, have no end date, and can only be revoked under unusual circumstances.

Members can't appeal fixed suspensions either but they have an expiration date.
In most cases fixed suspensions won't be for longer than a month unless decided otherwise.

## Appealing
Most bans are temporary and eventually expire, but members are always given the opportunity to appeal before that time has passed.
We provide a quick and easy way to file a ban appeal if you ever need to be unbanned in advance.
You can appeal a ban if at least one of the following are true:

* You have been banned on accident (referred to as a false ban).
* An admin has gone abusive and banned you for no reason (proof must be provided).
* You have been framed by another member.
* You have been range banned (when your general location is blacklisted).
* You have been banned and it has exceeded 24h, or someone has not purged the banlist yet.
* The offense committed was minor and did not deserve a ban.
* An administrator has told you to make a ban appeal.

### Filing an appeal
You may not appeal a temporary ban if you have been banned for the same reason over two times in a row.
If your ban message does not state that the ban was temporary, you may be suspended. You cannot appeal a suspension.
Use the form [here](https://shadowga.typeform.com/to/fE4jeV).

## Reporting
To call the attention of an administrator, you can use the `/report <player> <reason>` command.
If there aren't any admins on or the in-game feature just isn't cutting it, you can still help out.
We provide online reporting for when you need something more powerful.

### Filing a report
Online reports will ask the name of whoever's in question, what they did, and why you think they did it.
Reporting helps administrators improve their activity and effectively handle the situation.
Here's what we need for a good report:

* The member or admin must be clearly violating our forum or server conduct policy.
* Any offense the member made must be worthy of a report (remember, an administrator has to read it and deal with it themselves).
* Reasoning behind the member's actions if possible and how it affects you.
* A clear account of what happened.
* Willingness to speak with an administrator to further explain yourself if needed.
* Assurance that (in your mind) you think your report is accurate.

You can file a report through this form here.
It'll be read and we'll assign someone to deal with the problem.
Responding to these reports may take a while but it's important that the issue is taken care of.
If you've filed a report over three days ago and nothing's been done, let us know.

### Reporting admins
We also manage our admin team, so if an administrator has been abusing you can report them as well.
Admin reports can be filed through the same form mentioned above, but make sure to note that you're filing an admin report.

Submitted reports will be taken into the hands of our Executives to properly assess the issue.
If you're reporting an Executive, please directly contact the server owner instead.
Falsely reporting an admin is a punishable offense.
