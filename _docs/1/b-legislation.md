When members aren’t doing the right thing, admins are capable of punishing them.
It's important for everyone to know our administration's guidelines for proper gameplay and activity.

## Guidelines
Guidelines give the community a direct and consistent set of rules.
If you are caught violating the guidelines, an administrator can take the action they deem necessary—such as banning your account.

### General policy
This potion of our rules focuses on in-game conduct and gameplay etiquette.
These guidelines reflect the optimal behaviour practiced by example members.

 * **Don't harm the server.** Refrain from deliberately lagging or crashing the server. While we have plugins to prevent downtime, massive edits should only be performed with the permission of an administrator. Exploiting said plugins is forbidden.

   Lag machines will be removed and don't corrupt the game by using exploits such as chests and other various blocks. Flooding the chat with messages using text, commands, or hacks isn't allowed; spambots will be banned. Advertising isn't allowed in the main chat.

 * **Don't harm others.** Respect the wishes of other people and their privacy without circumstance. If you think you're annoying someone, it's best to stay away from them and respect their intent. Destroying the builds of others, called griefing, isn't allowed.

   Administrators are capable of rolling back any grief using a block logging tool. Avoid derogatory remarks—comments that are potentially sexist, racist, or intented to offend. Don't use hacks or exploits that can annoy others, such as potions or mobs.

 * **Don't be malicious.** Hacked clients are allowed, but they can't be harmful. Using hacks to unfairly fight, compete, or break other rules isn't allowed. Don't refer to malicious, pornographic, or hateful content in chat; and don't solicit illegality.

   Committing rogue activity as an administrator (such as abuse or intently violating the guidelines) will result in a suspension. Don't modify the inventory of others or their `tptoggle` without consent from that member. Attempting to frame people is forbidden. No plagiarism.

 * **Comply with staff.** You shouldn't try logging in with an alternate account when banned. Evading your ban by using a proxy or virtual private network isn't allowed and can result in a suspension. Don't attempt to undermine administrators.

   Offensive tags or nicknames will be removed. Threatening harm to yourself or other members will result in an immediate suspension. If an administrator doesn't like what they see, they're entitled to punish for something that isn't directly mentioned here; use common sense.
 
### Specific policy
We also prefer to maintain the freedom of speech on our forum, but regulation is necessary.
These guidelines also apply to the guild and other resources.

 * **Be respectful.** If someone is irritated, you're permitted to block other members; but don't block administrators. Inappropriate or offensive content on our forum and guild will be deleted and may result in a ban.

   Discussions made for the purpose of ranting will be removed. Members should only dispute in categories intended for formal debate. Being an annoyance on any of our platforms is unacceptable and therefore equals termination.

 * **Community etiquette.** Power-posting is usually defined as posting nonsensical messages or over-posting the same thing for no reason; don't do this. Instead, use the edit feature to make corrections when you can and don't make posts for short responses.

   If you are going to make a post, compliment it with a good, meaningful sentence that is easy to understand and worth somebody's time reading. Always make sure the tags you add to your discussion are relevant; irrelevant tags will be removed.

 * **Don't hijack threads.** Thread hijacking is replying to an existing discussion with a different topic. Only make posts that are relevant to the discussion you're posting them on, this is why our forum has tags.

   Only create discussions with a unique topic and always make sure somebody hasn't already discussed what you are posting. Don't use misleading information to catch the attention of our members. Advertising anywhere is prohibited.

 * **Control your account.** The account you create and keep secure is your responsibility. Don't let others have access to your account; change your password regularly and practice high [security](https://shadow.ga/docs/2/d-security/). If an alternate account acts up, your main account will also be sanctioned. 

   Members should notify an Executive or higher before making another account if they intend to do so. Anything that violates the United States law may be relayed to the appropriate authorities; we are based in the U.S. and work within its laws.

If you see anything with our name that's violating the posted guidelines or practices, it isn't us.
You can find out more about this matter [here](https://shadow.ga/docs/2/d-security/#watching-your-back).

#### Referral commands
 * `/motd` - Views the message of the day, with links to this page and more.
 * `/rules` - Directly refers members with a link to this page.

## Reporting
Other members that have visibly broken the guidelines can be reported.
There are different ways to report a member; one may be quicker for you than the other.

### In-game reports
Reporting a member in-game is very simple and requires no additional information than the name of who you're reporting; but you should still be careful with the tool and know what you're doing before filing a report.

 * `/help` - Provides a quick link to the guidelines (this page); helpful for new members.
 * `/report` - Reports a specified user and relays the message to administrators.
 
#### Command usage

> **Note:** You can't report administrators in-game or members that aren't online; you must know the username of who you're reporting. If this won't do, file an online report instead.

 * `/report <user> <reason>` - Files a report. Specifying a username and reason are both required.

### Online reports
Online reports will ask the name of whoever's in question, what they did, and why you think they did it.
Reporting helps administrators improve their activity and effectively handle the situation.

> **Note:** If you're filing an admin report, please make note of it on the form. If you're reporting an Executive, please [directly contact](https://shadow.ga/docs/1/d-support/#direct-support) the server owner instead.

You can file a report through the form [here](https://shadowga.typeform.com/to/On3kVf).
It'll be read and we'll assign someone to deal with the problem; if nothing happens, [let us know](https://shadow.ga/docs/1/d-support/#direct-support).

## Appealing
Most bans are temporary and eventually expire, but members are always given the opportunity to appeal before that time has passed.
We provide a quick and easy way to file a ban appeal; you can appeal a ban if at least one of the following are true:

 * You have been banned on accident (referred to as a false ban).
 * An admin has gone abusive and banned you for no reason (proof must be provided).
 * You have been framed by another member, were range banned, or unreasonably banned.
 * An administrator has told you to file an appeal.

> **Note:** Suspended members cannot file an appeal; appeals made by those suspended will be denied. All of our suspended members can be viewed on the [roster](https://f.shadow.ga/d/77-suspensions-roster-11-2017).

### Filing an appeal
You may not appeal a temporary ban if you have been banned for the same reason over two times in a row.
If your ban message does not state that the ban was temporary, you may be suspended. You cannot appeal a suspension.
Use the form [here](https://shadowga.typeform.com/to/fE4jeV).

If you've filed a ban appeal and you haven't been met with a response (reasonably), please [contact us](https://shadow.ga/docs/1/d-support/#direct-support) and we'll look through the records. If your ban was denied, please don't file duplicate entries.
