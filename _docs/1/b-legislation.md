When members aren’t doing the right thing, admins are capable of punishing them.
It's important for everyone to know our administration's guidelines for proper gameplay and activity.

## Guidelines
Guidelines give the community a direct and consistent set of rules.
If you are caught violating the guidelines, an administrator can take the action they deem necessary—such as banning your account.

### General policy
This potion of our rules focuses on in-game conduct and gameplay etiquette.
These guidelines reflect the optimal behaviour practiced by example members.

 * **Don't harm the server.** Refrain from deliberately lagging or crashing the server. While we have plugins to prevent downtime, massive edits should only be performed with the permission of an administrator. Exploiting said plugins is forbidden.

   Lag machines will be removed and don't corrupt the game by using exploits such as chests and other various blocks. Flooding the chat with messages using text, commands, or hacks isn't allowed; spambots will be banned. Advertising isn't allowed in the main chat.

- **Don't harm others.** Respect the wishes of other people and their privacy without circumstance. If you think you're annoying someone, it's best to stay away from them and respect their intent. Destroying the builds of others, called griefing, isn't allowed.

   Administrators are capable of rolling back any grief using a block logging tool. Avoid derogatory remarks—comments that are potentially sexist, racist, or intented to offend. Don't use hacks or exploits that can annoy others, such as potions or mobs.

- **Don't be malicious.** Hacked clients are allowed, but they can't be harmful. Using hacks to unfairly fight, compete, or break other rules isn't allowed. Don't refer to malicious, pornographic, or hateful content in chat; and don't solicit illegality.

   Committing rogue activity as an administrator (such as abuse or intently violating the guidelines) will result in a suspension. Don't modify the inventory of others or their `tptoggle` without consent from that member. Attempting to frame people is forbidden. No plagiarism.

- **Comply with staff.** You shouldn't try logging in with an alternate account when banned. Evading your ban by using a proxy or virtual private network isn't allowed and can result in a suspension. Don't attempt to undermine administrators.

   Offensive tags or nicknames will be removed. Threatening harm to yourself or other members will result in an immediate suspension. If an administrator doesn't like what they see, they're entitled to punish for something that isn't directly mentioned here; use common sense.
 
### Specific policy
We also prefer to maintain the freedom of speech on our forum, but regulation is necessary.
These guidelines also apply to the guild and other resources.

- **Be respectful.** If someone is irritated, you're permitted to block other members; but don't block administrators. Inappropriate or offensive content on our forum and guild will be deleted and may result in a ban.

   Discussions made for the purpose of ranting will be removed. Members should only dispute in categories intended for formal debate. Being an annoyance on any of our platforms is unacceptable and therefore equals termination.

- **Community etiquette.** Power-posting is usually defined as posting nonsensical messages or over-posting the same thing for no reason; don't do this. Instead, use the edit feature to make corrections when you can and don't make posts for short responses.

   If you are going to make a post, compliment it with a good, meaningful sentence that is easy to understand and worth somebody's time reading. Always make sure the tags you add to your discussion are relevant; irrelevant tags will be removed.

- **Don't hijack threads.** Thread hijacking is replying to an existing discussion with a different topic. Only make posts that are relevant to the discussion you're posting them on, this is why our forum has tags.

   Only create discussions with a unique topic and always make sure somebody hasn't already discussed what you are posting. Don't use misleading information to catch the attention of our members. Advertising anywhere is prohibited.

- **Control your account.** The account you create and keep secure is your responsibility. Don't let others have access to your account; change your password regularly and practice high [security](https://shadow.ga/docs/2/d-security/). If an alternate account acts up, your main account will also be sanctioned. 

   Members should notify an Executive or higher before making another account if they intend to do so. Anything that violates the United States law may be relayed to the appropriate authorities; we are based in the U.S. and work within its laws.

Keep on reading for more information on reporting those who break our policy.
If you see anything with our name that's violating the posted guidelines or practices, it isn't us.
You can find out more about this matter [here](https://shadow.ga/docs/2/d-security/#watching-your-back).

## Suspension
The status of being suspended can be given to any member that breaks the rules to a point where banning them is ineffective.
Members can be suspended by Executives or the Server Owner if they are petitioned to do so by another administrator.
Here are the penalties of suspension:

* You are banned from the server, meaning you can never join again. If you bypass this, you will remain under suspension.
* Your forum account is disabled, stripping you of all forum permissions.
* We'll ban your Discord account from the guild if you have one.
* Depending on how severe the crime is, you may be banned from visiting the website.
* If the crime is unlawful, such as threatening harm to yourself or others, your location and known alias will be forwarded to local authorities.

Depending on how severe the reason is, a member can be suspended indefinitely or for a fixed time.
Indefinite suspensions cannot be appealed, have no end date, and can only be revoked under unusual circumstances.

Members can't appeal fixed suspensions either but they have an expiration date.
In most cases fixed suspensions won't be for longer than a month unless decided otherwise.

## Appealing
Most bans are temporary and eventually expire, but members are always given the opportunity to appeal before that time has passed.
We provide a quick and easy way to file a ban appeal if you ever need to be unbanned in advance.
You can appeal a ban if at least one of the following are true:

* You have been banned on accident (referred to as a false ban).
* An admin has gone abusive and banned you for no reason (proof must be provided).
* You have been framed by another member.
* You have been range banned (when your general location is blacklisted).
* You have been banned and it has exceeded 24h, or someone has not purged the banlist yet.
* The offense committed was minor and did not deserve a ban.
* An administrator has told you to make a ban appeal.

### Filing an appeal
You may not appeal a temporary ban if you have been banned for the same reason over two times in a row.
If your ban message does not state that the ban was temporary, you may be suspended. You cannot appeal a suspension.
Use the form [here](https://shadowga.typeform.com/to/fE4jeV).

## Reporting
To call the attention of an administrator, you can use the `/report <player> <reason>` command.
If there aren't any admins on or the in-game feature just isn't cutting it, you can still help out.
We provide online reporting for when you need something more powerful.

### Filing a report
Online reports will ask the name of whoever's in question, what they did, and why you think they did it.
Reporting helps administrators improve their activity and effectively handle the situation.
Here's what we need for a good report:

* The member or admin must be clearly violating our forum or server conduct policy.
* Any offense the member made must be worthy of a report (remember, an administrator has to read it and deal with it themselves).
* Reasoning behind the member's actions if possible and how it affects you.
* A clear account of what happened.
* Willingness to speak with an administrator to further explain yourself if needed.
* Assurance that (in your mind) you think your report is accurate.

You can file a report through the form [here](https://shadowga.typeform.com/to/On3kVf).
It'll be read and we'll assign someone to deal with the problem.
Responding to these reports may take a while but it's important that the issue is taken care of.
If you've filed a report over three days ago and nothing's been done, let us know.

### Reporting admins
We also manage our admin team, so if an administrator has been abusing you can report them as well.
Admin reports can be filed through the same form mentioned above, but make sure to note that you're filing an admin report.

Submitted reports will be taken into the hands of our Executives to properly assess the issue.
If you're reporting an Executive, please directly contact the server owner instead.
Falsely reporting an admin is a punishable offense.
