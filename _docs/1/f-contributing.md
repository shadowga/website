There are many ways to contribute to our server; including architecture, development, and even contribution of money to help us out.
Contributing is a great way to assist not just the server, but our community as a whole.

## Donating
Although our server is a non-profit organisation, donating to the server helps our community thrive and pays the bills.
We attempt to not force donating on people and nothing on our server requires donating to unlock.
Administrators work voluntarily and no profit is made off of donations.

### The point of donating
As you may know, hosting the server and forum has a price and both costs are paid annually.
Besides the aid of financial discounts and money-saving procedures, payments have come mostly off of the owner.
Receiving donations helps soften the difficulty of paying a large sum every month to keep our community operational.
Here are a few benefits of making a donation:
* The warm and beneficial feeling of making a contribution to our server.
* Being labelled as a hero by our community.
* Receiving a sincere 'thank you' note from our staff.
* An attractive Title of Donor for your account on the forum and our Discord server.

### How to donate
Donating to the server is easy.
We accept multiple currencies, so members from all around the world can contribute.
Members can donate any amount they want (no matter how small) and pay using an account or with a credit card.
You can donate to us through the PayPal service [here](https://paypal.me/shadowga).

### After donating
Donations are processed manually and it usually takes us a few hours to check them.
If you've already made a donation and haven't been rewarded yet, please let us know!
Just contact us with your transaction ID (from an account or confirmation message) and we'll get you fixed up.

## Branding
To assure quality and consistency, we have some guidelines for the usage of our content.
These branding rules can help members make their own contributions and allow others to incorporate the design into their service.

### Using the logo
Our vector logo is brought to you by the folks who made GitHub Octicons, a free and open-source set of icons.
The red flame shouldn't be warped, disfigured, or recoloured when used in association with our server and forum.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://shadow.ga/img/logo-small.svg"></div>

Usually, we use the red flame to represent both our name and brand.
The flame is almost always used in our specific red, `#c0392b` (hsl: `5,63,46` and rgb: `192,57,43`).
You can use black, grey, or white if the logo can't be displayed in red.

### Website colours
We have a specific palette of colours to use on our website and forum.
Keeping track of our theme helps to keep everything clean around here.
For highlights, we will use the same type of red but dark blues use `#3c5675` (hsl: `212,32,34` and rgb: `60,86,117`) while light blues use `#88a6c5` (hsl: `210,34,65` and rgb: `136,166,197`) instead.
Black text isn't entirely black either, it's actually `#444444` (hsl: `0,0,26` and rgb: `68,68,68`).

### Press kit
We have a press kit you can download [here](https://shadow.ga/img/presskit.zip) for a sample of our logos, fonts, and colours.
If you're looking for something that isn't included in the press kit, you can send us a message and we'll do our best to get it for you.
Any art using the brand can be sent to us for approval.

## Other communities
Besides the server, our community mainly uses the forum and Discord server to get server-related information across.
Other communities help us promote ourselves while exploring the widely different member-bases of various places.

### What association is
Servers, Discord communities, and companies alike that have either reached out to us or have been specially requested as partnered by a server official are referred to as associated.
Being part of an associated community means the actions you make, whether positive or negative, reflect back to here.
If you wish to become part of an associated community, you must get to know their rules and respect their differences.

A list of associated communities can be found [here](https://f.shadow.ga/d/45-list-of-associated-communities-6-2017).
In some cases, a specific community may be added or removed.
We attempt to keep a positive relationship with these communities.

### Associate your community
New communities yet discovered by our members can always be added to our list through an association request.
The acceptance of a request can depend on multiple factors, but we have guidelines for associated communities that defines our expectations. Here's what we look for:
* The service must have some common interest with our server or website; and be helpful to the members of our community.
* Any well-established audience, base of users, or target demographic relevant to our purpose.
* Protection against content that could possibly break our guidelines or cross ethical boundaries.
* Providing an extension, beneficial third-party service, or tool to our members is encouraged.
* A similar administrative structure with moderation and a set of rules.

### Request association
To request association, you must have an administrative title or be the leader of the community you want to associate.
You can make a request to associate by contacting the owner and your offer will be considered over time.
