## Appealing
Most bans are temporary and eventually expire, but members are always given the opportunity to appeal before that time has passed.
We provide a quick and easy way to file a ban appeal if you ever need to be unbanned in advance.
You can appeal a ban if at least one of the following are true:

* You have been banned on accident (referred to as a false ban).
* An admin has gone abusive and banned you for no reason (proof must be provided).
* You have been framed by another member.
* You have been range banned (when your general location is blacklisted).
* You have been banned and it has exceeded 24h, or someone has not purged the banlist yet.
* The offense committed was minor and did not deserve a ban.
* An administrator has told you to make a ban appeal.

### Filing an appeal
You may not appeal a temporary ban if you have been banned for the same reason over two times in a row.
If your ban message does not state that the ban was temporary, you may be suspended. You cannot appeal a suspension.
The actual form is [here](https://shadowga.typeform.com/to/fE4jeV).

## Suspension
The status of being suspended can be given to any member that breaks the rules to a point where banning them is ineffective.
Members can be suspended by Executives or the Server Owner if they are petitioned to do so by another administrator.
Here are the penalties of suspension:

* You are banned from the server, meaning you can never join again. If you bypass this, you will remain under suspension.
* Your forum account is disabled, stripping you of all forum permissions.
* Depending on how severe the crime is, you may be banned from visiting the website.
* You may keep your guild membership as a form of emergency contact under circumstances.
* If the crime is unlawful, such as threatening harm to yourself or others, your location and known alias will be forwarded to local authorities.

Depending on how severe the reason is, a member can be suspended indefinitely or for a fixed time.
Indefinite suspensions cannot be appealed, have no end date, and can only be revoked under unusual circumstances.
Members can't appeal fixed suspensions either but they have an expiration date.
In most cases fixed suspensions won't be for longer than a month unless decided otherwise.
