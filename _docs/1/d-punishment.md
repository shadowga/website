When members aren't doing the right thing, admins are capable of punishing them.
You can appeal a ban depending on the offense's severity.
If you catch other people doing the wrong thing, you can take action.

## Appealing
Most bans are temporary and eventually expire, but members are always given the opportunity to appeal before that time has passed.
We provide a quick and easy way to file a ban appeal if you ever need to be unbanned in advance.
You can appeal a ban if at least one of the following are true:

* You have been banned on accident (referred to as a false ban).
* An admin has gone abusive and banned you for no reason (proof must be provided).
* You have been framed by another member.
* You have been range banned (when your general location is blacklisted).
* You have been banned and it has exceeded 24h, or someone has not purged the banlist yet.
* The offense committed was minor and did not deserve a ban.
* An administrator has told you to make a ban appeal.

### Filing an appeal
You may not appeal a temporary ban if you have been banned for the same reason over two times in a row.
If your ban message does not state that the ban was temporary, you may be suspended. You cannot appeal a suspension.
The actual form is [here](https://shadowga.typeform.com/to/fE4jeV).

## Suspension
The status of being suspended can be given to any member that breaks the rules to a point where banning them is ineffective.
Members can be suspended by Executives or the Server Owner if they are petitioned to do so by another administrator.
Here are the penalties of suspension:

* You are banned from the server, meaning you can never join again. If you bypass this, you will remain under suspension.
* Your forum account is disabled, stripping you of all forum permissions.
* We'll ban your Discord account from the guild if you have one.
* Depending on how severe the crime is, you may be banned from visiting the website.
* If the crime is unlawful, such as threatening harm to yourself or others, your location and known alias will be forwarded to local authorities.

Depending on how severe the reason is, a member can be suspended indefinitely or for a fixed time.
Indefinite suspensions cannot be appealed, have no end date, and can only be revoked under unusual circumstances.
Members can't appeal fixed suspensions either but they have an expiration date.
In most cases fixed suspensions won't be for longer than a month unless decided otherwise.

## Reporting
To call the attention of an administrator, you can use the `/report <player> <reason>` command.
If there aren't any admins on or the in-game feature just isn't cutting it, you can still help out.
We provide online reporting for when you need something more powerful.

### Filing a report
Online reports will ask the name of whoever's in question, what they did, and why you think they did it.
Reporting helps administrators improve their activity and effectively handle the situation.
Here's what we need for a good report:

* The member or admin must be clearly violating our forum or server conduct policy.
* Any offense the member made must be worthy of a report (remember, an administrator has to read it and deal with it themselves).
* Reasoning behind the member's actions if possible and how it affects you.
* A clear account of what happened.
* Willingness to speak with an administrator to further explain yourself if needed.
* Assurance that (in your mind) you think your report is accurate.

You can file a report with a quick and easy form here.
It'll be read and we'll assign someone to deal with the problem.
Responding to these reports may take a while but it's important that the issue is taken care of.
If you've submitted a report over three days ago and nothing's been done, let us know.

### Reporting admins
We also manage our admin team, so if an administrator has been abusing you can report them as well.
Admin reports can be filed through the same form mentioned above.
Your admin-related report will be taken into the hands of our Executives to assess the issue at hand.
Keep in mind that falsely reporting an admin is a punishable offense.
