If you're in need of support, we provide several resources for getting help.
Before considering any of these options we recommend you try troubleshooting the issue.

## Contact us
Maybe you need a hand, and in that case, we can help you out.
Our community has multiple layers of direct support if you're stumped on something.

### Before you ask
Different portions of our team are primarily knowledgable at different subjects.
We get a lot of questions, so here's what (we think) you should consider before contacting us:

* Ensure that you have searched our docs, forum, and guild; it could've already been mentioned.
* If it's a technical issue and you know how to fix it, make a suggestion instead.
* For issues outside of our services (such as game crashes, web problems), consult another source.

If none of these seem to work, we're here for you.
As mentioned previously, there are a few options at your arsenal to summon support.

### Platform support
To receive support from the forum, all you need to do is make sure that you have a forum account—then ask a question on the forum paired with the ‘support’ tag.
We'll answer you as soon as possible.

For guild-sourced support, you can get help through our guild's [#developer-chat](https://shadow.ga/docs/#channels).
It's also possible to directly message an Executive using Discord if you prefer talking privately.

> **Tip:** A list of our administrator's (and Executive's) contact information can be found [here](https://f.shadow.ga/d/5-list-of-administrators-12-2017)—the list of admins.

### Direct support
If you need the best of the best, we have official channels for Executive support.
When given the right information, our Executives can modify accounts and make changes to our resources.

 * ✉️ [`help@shadow.ga`](mailto:help@shadow.ga) - For general questions and account changes.
 * ✉️ [`urgent@shadow.ga`](mailto:urgent@shadow.ga) - For really important stuff. Please don't abuse this!

If you need direct help from the server owner, you can contact `@irix#5973` through Discord.
Please don't use in-game messaging (`/msg` or `/whisper`) to send confidential info, it can be read by admins.

## Website and forum
Issues with the homepage, documentation page, or forum can get complicated.
It's important to provide as much information as possible when you're reporting something.

### Browser support
Pages and discussions are loaded on several different platforms so we need to provide support for several browsers.
We recommend [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser) but you can also use Firefox or Opera.

> **Note:** Older versions of Chrome and some other browsers may not support the [protocols](https://shadow.ga/docs/2/d-security/#web-encryption) used by our services. To ensure compliance, we recommend using the latest version of your browser.

It's up to you, but keep in mind that we don't provide support for Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer.
When it comes to ad-blocking, it's completely optional since we never use advertisements.

### Error codes
If you navigate this website enough, you may make a typographical error and accidentally encounter an error page.
What you see when visiting one of these links describes the problem and gives you an error code.
Below is a list of every code, a quick summary of what they mean, and the steps we recommend you take to fix the problem.

#### html-cl-403
This error signifies that you do not have permission to access this page.
A developer could've modified the access permissions or made the content private.
* Ensure that you're supposed to be authorized in the first place.
* Make sure that you're logged into your forum account if the page contains a forum subdomain.
* Check to make sure that you aren't suspended if the page varies by account.

#### html-cl-404
Also known as a 404 error, this signifies that the page you have attempted to locate couldn't be found.
A link with this error code could easily have content in the future.
If the link previously contained content, it has likely either been deleted or moved to another link.

* Check for typographical or formatting errors in the link you used.
* If the link was from a bookmark or redirection; the content could've been modified or moved.
* Ensure that your link contains a proper extension at the end if needed.

#### html-se-500
This error signifies that there's an internal server error.
An internal error could've been the result of server downtime or a file misplacement.
Here's what you can do:

* Wait for a few minutes and reload the page to see if the error was repaired.
* Check official resources for notes about known errors or planned downtime.
* If none of the above solve the issue, notify an administrator.

#### html-se-503
Generally a forum error, this signifies that the service in question is down for maintenance.
Under certain circumstances it can also indicate an overload in traffic.
Usually these errors are only temporary and are on purpose to save data when content is being developed.

* Wait for a few minutes and reload the page to see if the error was repaired.
* Check another resource for notes about known errors or planned downtime.
* Try accessing similar pages under the same subdomain to see if they function.
* If none of the above solve the issue, notify an administrator.

### Cloudflare errors
Any error generated by Cloudflare may be a result of problems with their service.
If the error signifies that the problem is on our end, notify an administrator.

## Propose and reveal
As an open-source server with operations public to everyone, we try to make revealing issues and proposing suggestions fairly easy.
For this reason we have the community, allowing members to share their take on an idea.

### Issues
An issue is an unintentional fault, exploit, or bug that shouldn't be there.
This isn't the same as a suggestion because you aren't proposing a feature.
Issues can vary from problems with features to obvious errors in our provided services.

If you see an issue, you shouldn't leave it alone!
Getting bugs squashed is very important to the overall stability of our server and forum.
It's best to file a report when you find one, and try to provide additional information.

### Suggestions
A suggestion can be a feature or change you'd like to see implemented.
You can even propose small changes; like something grammatical or cosmetic.
We encourage members to improve our documentation with suggestions as well.

Don't be afraid to propose what you have in mind, we won't discriminate.
Listening to the people is important to us; new and exciting features are often the result of a good suggestion.

### Taking action
To get started, you can create a discussion on our forum.
If your discussion is about an issue, please use the 'development' tag paired with a sub-tag (server, forum, or resource pack).
If it's about a suggestion, use the 'suggestions' tag instead.

> **Note:** Since this is a fairly democratic process, we need some replies before closing the discussion—this may take a while. Patience is key.

After your post is voted on by our administrator team, a verdict can be reached by an Executive or above.
Here's some tips for constructing a good post with all the facts:

* Make sure you're original and check for identical discussions.
* Give a clear description of the problem or what you want to suggest.
* Ensure that the problem is reproducible if you're revealing an issue.
* Describe how your proposal would benefit us if you're proposing something.
