We have different types of worlds so members may choose any environment they like.
While every world shares the same set of guidelines, they can help distinguish the atmosphere and design of builds.
Different worlds are also great for activities such as melee or architect competitions.

## Switching worlds
Worlds can be switched by any member.
To do this, we have the command `/world`, which allows you to specify different types of worlds to visit.
Most worlds have a custom alias command that teleports you there. Different types of worlds can be accessed by different types of members.

### The Flatlands
The flatlands is the default world you spawn in.
You can build anything anywhere in this world, and it wipes every month to prevent lag.
 * `/spawn` - Teleports a player to the spawn (in the flatlands).
 * `/flatlands` - Teleports a player to the flatlands.

### The Roughlands
The roughlands is very similar to the flatlands except there are rough biomes, such as trees and oceans.
This world is only wiped along with the netherlands and roughlands.
 * `/roughlands` - Teleports a player to the roughlands.

### The Netherlands
The netherlands is the nether world for anyone to join in.
There is lava and a large amount of netherrack, which is not wiped often.
This world is only wiped along with the roughlands and enderlands.
 * `/nether` - Teleports a player to the nether world.

### The Enderlands
The enderlands is the opposite of the netherlands.
It houses end stone and end villages as of the 1.9 update, and is also known as the place where you can slay the ender dragon.
This world is only wiped along with the roughlands and netherlands.
 * `/ender` - Teleports a player to the end world.

### The Adminworld
The adminworld is a private world that only Super Admins and above can go in.
It is never wiped, and houses the adminworld village.
On occasion, an admin can invite someone as a "guest", allowing them to join the adminworld for a small amount of time until the server restarts.
When operators are not invited as guests, it is impossible for them to enter this world.
 * `/adminworld` - Teleports an administrator to the adminworld.

## Using Dynmap
Dynmap, as abbreviated in the name, is a dynamic map generator.
This plugin can generate a bird's-eye view of any world through your web browser.
With the online interface, you can also view statistics and use the in-game chat.

### Using the interface
The map can be opened like any other webpage [here](http://b.shadow.ga:8123).
From there, it will take you to the default world (flatlands).
By clicking on the arrow to your right, you can select different worlds, switch to different render modes, and view a list of online members.
Chat messages will be displayed at the bottom-left next to the hyperlink button.

### Online chat
If the plugin is able to link your in-game address with that of your connection to Dynmap, you can send messages.
Members on the server will be able to read your chat messages as if you were talking through Minecraft.
Dynmap-sent messages can be distinguished by the `[WEB]` prefix that precedes anything sent through the interface.
Messages sent by members in-game can also show display a text bubble relative to their position.

### Map filters
On the top-left, you can click on a layer button to filter out certain objects.
Both options are enabled by default and deselecting either one will automatically update the render.
The `markers` option shows where spawnpoints are located and `players` identifies the location of all online members.

### Other information
At the top-center, it will display the Minecraft world-specific time along with an animated representation.
Under the filters button, it will show the world coordinates in relation to where your cursor is located.
The top-right image will display a compass for directional reference.

## Resource pack
Our server uses a custom resource pack that gives builders the ability to add more detail in their creations.
We recommend that all members have it installed.

### Downloading
If the server does not notify you to install the resource pack automatically, you can download and apply it manually.
The resource pack is an open-source project and we use a repository for easy editing and the ability to quickly make changes.
This means that you can obtain the newest version from your browser from [here](https://github.com/shadowga/resourcepack/archive/master.zip).

### Installation
After successfully downloading the resource pack, you can install and activate it normally.
It may take up to a minute for your game to initialize the textures, and then you should be returned to the options menu.
You have now completed all the steps and your resource pack should be fully working as you join any server.
