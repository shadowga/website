We're a modern creative server for Minecraft. We give members every command they need to powerfully build and enjoy our server without meeting any requirements.

### Features
We aim to provide the best experience for every member on our server. This means adding useful features and big changes depending on what they want in a server. Several extensions are installed, from essential commands like WorldEdit to customisation interfaces.

- **Quick and easy.** Members can come onto the server and build whenever they want. We don't have any time restrictions and there isn't any application required to start helping our community.

- **Do anything you want.** Our server has the least possible amount of rules to give our members a feeling of freedom. There are no restrictions to what you can build, we just ask that your builds mind other people. We respect privacy, so members are allowed to build as close or as far away from the starting point as they want.

- **Efficient administration.** Rule breakers can be easily tracked thanks to our administration team, which is given powerful tools that allow it to enforce rules on our server. Any grief caused by members can be easily fixed, we have a reliable logging system. Administrators can control the server when they aren't playing the game with panels like telnet.

- **Free and open.** You don't need building expertise or any skills to join. Our server is public to all and so is our online community, the forum. We allow you to chat with other server members on the go with our Discord server.

## Website
The website provides fundamentals; such as information, referrals, and resources.
It's also great to master these tools, and you can start by learning how we commit different sections.

### Homepage
Our homepage is the first page enveloping `shadow.ga`—you know, with the funny text and big red mountains.
Other pages branching from our homepage (such as error pages) can provide material.
This and akin files are powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Flarum](http://flarum.org/).

We provide guidelines, instructions, and guides on our documentation; so newcomers can learn with ease.
You're even reading a docs page right now and you can quickly jump to pages with the left-hand table.

> **Notes** and **tips** like this one signify knowledge that isn't necessarily definite but important. **Upcoming** blocks detail assets we're still trying to implement—also subject to revision.

Everyone should thoroughly read our documentation so they know how to get around.
Information also helps with using the exclusive features of our server, forum, and other resources.

### Social media
Social media is used for communicating announcements and other important information.
We have a [Twitter](/twitter/) for sending quick messages and all tweets are relayed to the guild in #announcements.

Our [GitHub](/github/) organization is great for the open-source development of resources such as this website—and don't forget our Medium [blog](/blog/).

### Community
We'll often refer to our forum as the 'community' to keep things simple—a feature great for online collaboration and discourse.
Getting started on the community is nice and simple, we don't ask for much; anyone can sign up through our database or GitHub—but please [enable](https://shadow.ga/docs/2/d-security/#activating-two-factor-login) two-factor auth.
If you'd like your account deleted, just let us know.

Discussions are thread-like posts that (when made) will show up on the community's front page.
When a discussion is getting a lot of replies, it'll stay on the front for everyone to see.
You can talk about anything on the community, but we have tags for organisation; be specific but don't abuse them.

## Guild
The guild is our Discord server where anyone can talk to each other in real time.
This service is great for sharing content, collaboration, and quick support; you can either join by clicking the 'guild' button on our navigation bar or through [this link](/guild/).

### Automation
We use bots to emulate a personal assistant for every member.
Bots have a wide variety of command and may cover customisation to specification.
They can't be used in-game.

 * `/` - Triggers a pop-up menu listing the built-in commands of our Discord guild.
 * `.help` - Provides a list of the [Some Dragon](https://github.com/robingall2910/RobTheBoat) bot's commands via a personal message.
 * `t!help` - Provides a list of the [Tatsumaki](https://www.tatsumaki.xyz/) bot's commands via a personal message.

### Text channels
Similar to the forum, different topics have their own channel.
The #general-chat is for just about anything while spam goes in the #spam-chat.
Developers can do their thing in #developer-chat, controversial or inappropriate stuff goes in #nsfw-chat, and commands go in #commands.

Everything's pretty straightforward, administrators even have a chat for their own roles.

### Voice channels
You can talk to each other using Discord's voice service.
The way channels are organised is very similar to text, but members breaking our guidelines can be muted.
Discord has a pretty nice voice codec and you can fine-tune your microphone and voice through the settings.

## Server
Our Minecraft server is what we're built around.
We provide operator permissions for anyone without hassle, an assortment of plugins, and powerful tools for building and administration.

### Connection
It's easy to join the server.
You can connect by typing the domain `shadow.ga` as a server address using the direct connect box or by adding us to your in-game list.
Using a port isn't required but if you need one there's `25599`.

 * `/status` - Displays the server's current state and loaded worlds.
 * `/memory` - Projects memory statistics, loaded worlds, and ticks per second (TPS).
 * `/mem` - An alias of the previous command and serves the same function.

We provide support for both newer and older clients, from `1.12.2` all the way back to `1.7.2`.
Support for older client versions may change as the game updates.

### Economy
With an economy, members are capable of making transactions for shop items and developing their own wealth.
Money is presented in the form of coins and you can manage them.

#### Using the shop
To earn coins, you can [vote](https://www.planetminecraft.com/server/shadowrealms---a-server-where-everyone-gets-op/) for the server and complete in-game chat reactions.
Once you build up enough coins, you can purchase from the shop; items like login messages and weapons.
 
 * `/coins` - Displays your current wealth; coins attributed to your user.
 * `/shop` - Opens up the shop. From here you can purchase items.
 
#### Shop management
Senior Admins and higher can manage the shop with an administrator tool.
Shop management allows for economy modification and the addition of new coins.

> **Note:** Only remove or 'set' coins with the permission of an Executive or higher. Giving out coins can potentially unbalance the server economy, resulting in inflation.

 * `/manageshop coins add <amount> <user | all>` - Gives an amount of coins to someone.
 * `/manageshop coins remove <amount> <user | all>` - Takes away an amount of coins from someone.
 * `/manageshop coins set <amount> <user | all>` - Sets a definite amount of coins for someone.
 
The `all` function will only apply to members that are online; the `set` function will override pre-existing coins.

### Other information
Now that you know the basics, it's time to learn everything.
Information about the server's guidelines, ranks, and worlds is all available throughout our documentation.
You can either click the 'next' button or manually navigate to begin.
