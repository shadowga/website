We're a modern creative server for Minecraft. We give members every command they need to powerfully build and enjoy our server without meeting any requirements.

### Features
We aim to provide the best experience for every member on our server. This means adding useful features and big changes depending on what they want in a server. Several extensions are installed, from essential commands like WorldEdit to customisation interfaces.

- **Quick and easy.** Members can come onto the server and build whenever they want. We don't have any time restrictions and there isn't any application required to start helping our community.

- **Do anything you want.** Our server has the least possible amount of rules to give our members a feeling of freedom. There are no restrictions to what you can build, we just ask that your builds mind other people. We respect privacy, so members are allowed to build as close or as far away from the starting point as they want.

- **Efficient administration.** Rule breakers can be easily tracked thanks to our administration team, which is given powerful tools that allow it to enforce rules on our server. Any grief caused by members can be easily fixed, we have a reliable logging system. Administrators can even control the server when they aren't playing the game with panels like telnet.

- **Free and open.** You don't need building expertise or any skills to join. Our server is public to all and so is our online community, the Shadow.GA forum. We even allow you to chat with other server members on the go with our Discord server.

### Joining the server
It's easy to join the server.
You can connect by typing the domain `shadow.ga` as a server address using the direct connect box or by adding us to your in-game list.
Using a port isn't required but if you need one there's `25599`.
We provide support for both newer and older clients, from `1.12` all the way back to `1.7.2`.
The amount of older client versions may update as the game changes over time.

### Joining the forum
Our online community, or forum, can be joined by making a brand new account or signing up through GitHub.
Registration through GitHub doesn't require e-mail verification, but the other method will send a confirmation e-mail to the address you signed up with.
From there, you can make posts and share ideas to everyone.

### Joining the guild
The Discord guild is also easy to join, and it's a great place for live chat and support.
All you need is an account and you can click the 'chat' link on our navigation bar to receive an invite.
We have several channels to make quick discussion easier for anyone.
You can even do audio-related activities such as join a voice channel to discuss, listen, or play music.
