We're a modern creative server for Minecraft. We give members every command they need to powerfully build and enjoy our server without meeting any requirements.

### Features
We aim to provide the best experience for every member on our server. This means adding useful features and big changes depending on what they want in a server. Several extensions are installed, from essential commands like WorldEdit to customisation interfaces.

- **Quick and easy.** Members can come onto the server and build whenever they want. We don't have any time restrictions and there isn't any application required to start helping our community.

- **Do anything you want.** Our server has the least possible amount of rules to give our members a feeling of freedom. There are no restrictions to what you can build, we just ask that your builds mind other people. We respect privacy, so members are allowed to build as close or as far away from the starting point as they want.

- **Efficient administration.** Rule breakers can be easily tracked thanks to our administration team, which is given powerful tools that allow it to enforce rules on our server. Any grief caused by members can be easily fixed, we have a reliable logging system. Administrators can control the server when they aren't playing the game with panels like telnet.

- **Free and open.** You don't need building expertise or any skills to join. Our server is public to all and so is our online community, the forum. We allow you to chat with other server members on the go with our Discord server.

## Website
We have a range of online services and you're on one of them.
Our homepage and public documentation are great places to learn about the server.
It's also great to master these tools, and you can start by learning how we do things around here.

### Homepage
Everyone begins at the homepage when they're checking us out for the first time.
The homepage is the first page you see when you visit `shadow.ga`—you know, with the funny text and big red mountains.
There isn't much to see but you can quickly navigate our website and follow us on social media.

### Documentation
The documentation page is great... especially if you're new.
In fact, you're reading a page from our documentation right now!
Reading our docs allows you to understand everything with just a few pages.
It's required for everyone to read through this so you don't mess up on accident.

### Social media
Social media is used for communicating announcements and other important information.
We have a [Twitter](/twitter) for sending quick messages and all tweets are relayed to the guild in #announcements.

Our [GitHub](/github) organization is great for the open-source development of resources such as this website—and don't forget our [blog](/blog), powered by Medium. 

## Community
We'll often refer to our forum as the 'community' to keep things simple.
Call it anything you want, but this feature is great for online collaboration and discourse.
The forum and this website in general is made possible by the folks over at Flarum.

### Making an account
Getting started on the community is nice and simple, we don't ask for much information.
You'll either need an e-mail and password or you can sign up with a GitHub account.
Check out the security page for advice on that.
If you'd like your account deleted, just let us know.

### Discussions
Discussions are thread-like posts that (when made) will show up on the community's front page.
When a discussion is getting a lot of replies, it'll stay on the front for everyone to see.

They're called discussions because you can endlessly *discuss* anything.
Posts that are violating our guidelines can be locked or deleted.

### Tags and categories
You can talk about anything on the community, but we have categories called 'tags' for organisation.
When you're making a discussion, make sure to use the right tag!
Try and get as specific with tags as possible so everyone has a better experience, but please don't abuse them.

### Customisation
Try customising your profile!
You can set your own profile picture and short biography to tell us about yourself.
Try adding a button; they're public links that you can add to your profile and can go to anything (website, repository, project, etc).

We still want you to keep it appropriate and profiles violating our guidelines will be removed.

## Guild
The guild is our Discord server where anyone can talk to each other in real time.
This service is great for sharing content, collaboration, and quick support.
It's completely optional unless you're an admin but greatly improves the server experience.

### Joining the guild
You'll need to make a Discord account if you don't already have one.
When that's set, you can either join by clicking the 'guild' button on our navigation bar or through [this link](/guild).
Then you'll be invited to the guild and will instantly become a full-fledged cool person.

### Text channels
Similar to the forum, different topics have their own channel.
The #general-chat is for just about anything while spam goes in the #spam-chat.
Developers can do their thing in #developer-chat, controversial or inappropriate stuff goes in #nsfw-chat, and commands go in #commands.

Everything's pretty straightforward, administrators even have a chat for their own roles.

### Voice channels
You can talk to each other using Discord's voice service.
The way channels are organised is very similar to text, but members breaking our guidelines can be muted.
Discord has a pretty nice voice codec and you can fine-tune your microphone and voice through the settings.

## Server
Our Minecraft server is what we're built around.
We provide operator permissions for anyone without hassle, an assortment of plugins, and powerful tools for building and administration.

### Connection
It's easy to join the server.
You can connect by typing the domain `shadow.ga` as a server address using the direct connect box or by adding us to your in-game list.
Using a port isn't required but if you need one there's `25599`.

We provide support for both newer and older clients, from `1.12.2` all the way back to `1.7.2`.
Support for older client versions may change as the game updates.

### Becoming an operator
Members are referred to as 'operators' in-game.
You be added to operator by one of our administrators.
It doesn't take any qualifications or approval to become an operator.
If you're punisished by an admin, your operator may be revoked and you'll need an admin to re-op you.

### Other information
Now that you know the basics, it's time to learn everything.
Information about the server's guidelines, ranks, and worlds is all available throughout our documentation.
You can either click the 'next' button or manually navigate to begin.
