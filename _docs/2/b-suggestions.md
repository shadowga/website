As an open-source server with operations public to everyone, we try to make reporting bugs and proposing suggestions fairly easy.
For this reason we have an online forum that allows other members to share their take on the issue or proposal.
This page outlines what to do if you are interested in shining light on an issue or suggesting something to make our server better.

## What an issue is
An issue is a fault in any system or a weakness not meant to be there.
This is different from a suggestion, where you are proposing a feature that doesn't exist already.
Issues can vary from already implemented features that aren't working to obvious errors in our server or forum.
This may also be referred to as a bug.

## What a suggestion is
A suggestion is something not yet implemented that you would like to see on here.
Usually people suggest big changes like introducing a new feature, but people can also suggest small changes (even grammatical or cosmetic).
Suggestions may or may not be accepted depending on how much of a change they would make and how you could implement it.

## Requirements
* You must have a forum account.
* You must make sure that nobody has made a discussion about your same topic.
* A clear description of the problem or what you want to suggest.
* If this is an issue, please ensure that the problem is reproducible.
* If this is a suggestion, please describe how your proposal would benefit us.

## How to do it
To reveal an issue, you may start a discussion with the 'development' topic on our forum.
When making an issue discussion, please use sub-topics to make clear what the problem is about.
To make a suggestion, you may start a discussion with the 'suggestions' topic.
As mentioned above, please use the correct sub-topic.
Most importantly, happy contributing and thank you.
