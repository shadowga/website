To assure quality and consistency, we have some guidelines for the usage of our content.
These branding rules can help members make their own contributions and allow others to incorporate the design into their service.

### Using the logo
Our vector logo is brought to you by the folks who made GitHub Octicons, a free and open-source set of icons.
The red flame shouldn't be warped, disfigured, or recoloured when used in association with our server and forum.

Usually, we use the red flame to represent both our name and brand.
The flame is almost always used in our specific red, `#c0392b` (hsl: `5,63,46` and rgb: `192,57,43`).
You can use black, grey, or white if the logo can't be displayed in red.

### Website colours
We have a specific palette of colours to use on our website and forum.
Keeping track of our theme helps to keep everything clean around here.
For highlights, we will use the same type of red but dark blues use `#3c5675` (hsl: `212,32,34` and rgb: `60,86,117`) while light blues use `#88a6c5` (hsl: `210,34,65` and rgb: `136,166,197`) instead.
Black text isn't entirely black either, it's actually `#444444` (hsl: `0,0,26` and rgb: `68,68,68`).

### Press kit
We have a press kit you can download for a sample of our logos, fonts, and colours.
If you're looking for something that isn't included in the press kit, you can send us a message and we'll do our best to get it for you.
