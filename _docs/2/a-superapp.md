Super Admin is the basic administrator rank. They are given banning and smiting
abilities, and full access to grief logging plugins. Super Admins are also allowed
to use some commands that are blocked to operators, such as `/tpo` and `/say`.

This rank can be applied for by operators, the default rank. However, there are
requirements that have to be met to obtain Super Admin.

## Requirements
* You must have been active on the server for over thirty days (unless told otherwise by an Executive or higher).
* You must know the conduct policy and documentation.
* You must have not been banned (accidental bans don't count) for at least twenty days.
* You must have basic knowledge of the English language and grammar.
* You must be willing to devote time to the server.

## Applying
Super Admin can be applied for by filling out a short and quick form.
After that form is completed, your application will be read and reviewed.
If we approve your application, the forum account you used in the application will be added to admin.
