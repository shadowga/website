Although our server is non-profit, donating to the server helps our community thrive and pays the bills.
We attempt to not force donating on people and nothing on our server requires donating to unlock.
Administrators work voluntarily and no profit is made off of donations.

## The point of donating
As you may know, keeping our virtual private servers up cost money and we pay monthly for it.
Besides the aid of financial discounts and money-saving procedures, payments have come mostly off of the owner.
Receiving donations helps soften the difficulty of paying a large sum every month to keep our community operational.

## The benefits of donating
* The warm and beneficial feeling of making a contribution to our server.
* Being labelled as a hero by our community.
* Receiving a sincere 'thank you' note from our staff.
* An attractive Title of Donator for your account on the forum and our Discord server.

## How to donate
Donating for the server is easy.
We use the PayPal donation method so members from all around the world can feel free to contribute.
Members can donate any amount they want (no matter how small) and pay using a PayPal account or with a credit card.
