Although our server is a non-profit organisation, donating to the server helps our community thrive and pays the bills.
We attempt to not force donating on people and nothing on our server requires donating to unlock.
Administrators work voluntarily and no profit is made off of donations.

### The point of donating
As you may know, hosting the server and forum has a price and both costs are paid annually.
Besides the aid of financial discounts and money-saving procedures, payments have come mostly off of the owner.
Receiving donations helps soften the difficulty of paying a large sum every month to keep our community operational.
Here are a few benefits of making a donation:
* The warm and beneficial feeling of making a contribution to our server.
* Being labelled as a hero by our community.
* Receiving a sincere 'thank you' note from our staff.
* An attractive Title of Donor for your account on the forum and our Discord server.

### How to donate
Donating to the server is easy.
We accept multiple currencies, so members from all around the world can contribute.
Members can donate any amount they want (no matter how small) and pay using an account or with a credit card.
You can donate to us through the PayPal service [here](https://paypal.me/shadowga).

### After donating
Donations are processed manually and it usually takes us a few hours to check them.
If you've already made a donation and haven't been rewarded yet, please let us know!
Just contact us with your transaction ID (from an account or confirmation message) and we'll get you fixed up.
