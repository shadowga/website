Having an effective and reliable team is imperative, and that's why we carefully manage our administrators.
Some admins manage more than others depending on their ability; a ranking system is used for institution.

## Hierarchy
Having a hierarchy of ranks is a great way of classifying our community, although the two should not be confused as they carry important differences.
Knowing our various ranks allows members to identify and communicate with administrators easily.

### Super Admins
Super Admins are the basic administrators. They are given banning and smiting abilities, and full access to grief logging plugins. Super Admins are allowed to use some commands that are blocked for operators such as `/tpo` and `/say`.

### Telnet Admins
Telnet Admins are given the same commands as Super Admins except they can use [telnet](https://shadow.ga/docs/3/d-resources/#telnet-server). Our telnet server allows members with the rank to administrate even when they are not on Minecraft. This is useful for on-the-go devices such as phones, which have apps supporting telnet.

### Senior Admins
Senior Admins have all the abilities as the above ranks. They're also given extra commands that are blocked to lower ranks; like `/time` and `/weather`. The Senior Admin rank is also required for non-applicable ranks, such as Executive and Developer.

### Executive Admins
Executives are in charge of all other admin ranks, except for the owner. They have the ability to suspend disobedient or rogue administrators, and even ban them if required. They're also in charge of marketing the server to members when the owners are unable to. You probably won't even see these admins in-game that often, that's because they also take care of resources like the forum.

## Appointment
We always keep an eye out for potential administrators as the server grows.
While there are different ranks of admin, they all have one thing in common and that is to be reliable and helpful.
This is why candidates for the position are hand-picked based on how they present themselves to everyone.
Here's what we look for:
* The ability to act mature and professional in difficult situations.
* Maintained control over problems when put under heavy stress by other members.
* Knowledge of our rules and helpfulness to inexperienced newcomers.
* Activity and membership on all of our platforms (on and off the server).
* The tendancy to stay out of trouble and remain honest at all times.
* Members who go out of their way to improve other people's experiences.
* Good communicators, people who know the English language well and can talk to people clearly.

If the above sounds like you, make sure to let us know.
Maybe that description reminds you of someone else?
If so, you can directly message an admin to recommend them.

### Selection
If you're already an administrator; you can select a member for the position.
Selected members are expected to stand out from everyone else and meet all of the above requirements.
By selecting a member, you agree that they represent a model candidate in your eyes and bring a higher-ranked admin's attention to the member.
We have a few requirements for selection:
* An administrator can only select one member per year.
* The member must meet all qualities of our selection checklist (shown above).
* The member must have not been banned (accidental bans don't count) on the server or forum for at least twenty days or has made a valid appeal for each ban they received.
* The member must have a forum account with two-factor auth enabled.
* The member must have a Discord account connected to our guild, also with two-factor auth enabled.

### Selecting a member
To choose a member, they must agree to become an admin and vow to fulfill all tasks expected of them.
Once you have chosen someone you want to select, you can directly message an Executive or higher and they will the make decision to appoint them or not.

## Management
As mentioned earlier, we organise our staff so members can go to the right person for help.
Depending on what someone wants to administrate or how they perform, they can be promoted or demoted.
Our Executive team helps manage lower-ranked administrators by evaluating their actions in-game.

### Promotion
When admins further improve themselves, the owner can issue a promotion to them which will up their position in the administrator hierarchy.

This usually occurs because a higher-ranking admin resigns or goes inactive, which opens an opportunity for promotion.
When we need to promote someone, we usually look for three things; experience, helpfulness, and activity.

### Demotion
Promotions can also work the other way around, as admins can be demoted back to a lower rank as a punishment or to better organise the team.

Executives are capable of demoting or suspending administrators if they've broken the conduct policy, acted improperly, or failed to do their job.
Demotions can also be a result of inactivity and an admin can have themselves demoted on request.
