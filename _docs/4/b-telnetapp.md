title: 4b. Applying for Telnet Admin
permalink: /docs/4/b-telnetapp/
---

Telnet Admins are given the same commands as Super Admins, but they can use features like the telnet server.
Our telnet server allows admins to control the server even when they are not on Minecraft.
This is useful for on-the-go devices such as phones, which have apps supporting it.

This rank can be applied for by Super Admins; however, there are requirements that have to be met to obtain Telnet Admin.

## Requirements
* You must have been Super Admin for over two months.
* You must have one Senior Admin recommendation.
* You must have basic knowledge of Telnet and how it works.

## Applying
Telnet Admin can be applied for by filling out a short and quick form.
After that form is completed, your application will be read and reviewed.
If we approve your application, the forum account you used in the form will be added to Telnet Admin.
