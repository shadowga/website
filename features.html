      <h4>Two-Pane Interface</h4>
      <p>Quickly work your way through unread discussions, without having to go back to the discussion list or open dozens of tabs. Bring your mouse to the left side of the screen and the discussion list will conveniently appear.</p>

      <h4>Infinite Scrolling</h4>
      <p>Keep on scrolling, without having to wait for the next page of posts to load. Flarum lets you scrub anywhere in a discussion quickly and easily. It remembers your position if you come back after navigating away.</p>

      <h4>Floating Composer</h4>
      <p>Read while you write. Flarum's reply form slides up from the bottom of the page, so you can scroll up to read posts – and even visit other discussions – while you draft your reply.</p>
