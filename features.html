    <h3>Online interface</h3>
    <p>Built with Jekyll (and powered by Flarum), our website and corresponding pages are designed for straightforward access.</p>

      <h4>Simple and consistent</h4>
      <p>Our services are built with identical design principals from the ground up, aiming at an ideal environment.</p>
      <p>We look towards improving the general usage of these platforms.</p>

      <h4>Cross-platform support</h4>
      <p>Most of our services have been developed with support for mobile devices (and other platforms) in mind.</p>
      <p>For in-game, members have browser-bound services, like Dynmap and Telnet.</p>

      <h4>Foremost security</h4>
      <p>No matter what you're doing, all of our services utilise end-to-end security and are up to the latest (transparent) specifications in web encryption publicly available.</p>
      <p>All account-based programmes take advantage of features like two-factor authentication and database monitoring.</p>

    <h3>Touch-Optimized</h3>
    <p>
      Flarum is fully responsive by default, and not just as an afterthought.<br>
      The interface has been optimized for touch, with big buttons, smooth animations, and gestures aplenty.

      <h4>Swipe Gestures</h4>
      <p>Swipe a discussion to the right to mark it as read. Swipe it to the left to bring up more controls. This webpage is on steroids.</p>

      <h4>Smooth Animations</h4>
      <p>Animations take advantage of hardware acceleration, so they're silky smooth and won't slow you down.</p>

      <h4>Optimized, Inside and Out</h4>
      <p>The desktop and mobile versions of Flarum use exactly the same templates. That means less work for developers, and a more consistent interface for users, no matter what size your device.</p>
