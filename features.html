    <h3>Online interface</h3>
    <p>Built with Jekyll (and powered by Flarum), our website and corresponding pages are designed for straightforward access.</p>
  </header>

      <h4>Simple and consistent</h4>
      <p>Our services are built with identical design principals from the ground up, aiming at an ideal environment.</p>
      <p>We look towards improving the general usage of these platforms.</p>

      <h4>Cross-platform support</h4>
      <p>Most of our services have been developed with support for mobile devices (and other platforms) in mind.</p>
      <p>For in-game, members have browser-bound services, like Dynmap and Telnet.</p>

      <h4>Foremost security</h4>
      <p>No matter what you're doing, all of our services utilise end-to-end security and are up to the latest (transparent) specifications in web encryption publicly available.</p>
      <p>All account-based programmes take advantage of features like two-factor authentication and database monitoring.</p>

    <h3>In-game server</h3>
    <p>The server is what we're built around, and is where the magic happens. Our server is the centre of all architectural operations.</p>

      <h4>Blazing fast</h4>
      <p>With dedicated hosting, near-perfect response times and almost-static uptime become apparent.</p>
      <p>If server lag becomes an issue, administrators are given the tools to effectively handle it.</p>

      <h4>Periodic backups</h4>
      <p>Your stuff is safe, as routine backups are taken of the server, ready for restoration in case of an emergency.</p>
      <p>Members can also download schematics and other important information using a web interface.</p>

      <h4>Bedrock bridge</h4>
      <p>Soon, members using the Bedrock platform will be able to join our server and play online, just like Java Edition.</p>
      <p>This (upcoming) capability will provide even further cross-platform and mobile support.</p>

      <h4>Block logging</h4>
      <p>Our server uses the CoreProtect extension to globally prevent builds from being griefed or damaged.</p>
      <p>Administrators are capable of 'rolling back' and restoring any block-made content that has been logged.</p>

      <h4>Optimized, Inside and Out</h4>
      <p>The desktop and mobile versions of Flarum use exactly the same templates. That means less work for developers, and a more consistent interface for users, no matter what size your device.</p>
